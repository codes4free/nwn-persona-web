Sold into debt slavery, Hazel toiled in a coal mine, where he met Rajit, a necromancer and true father figure, who taught him the arts of Valsheeron. After Rajit\u2019s sacrificial death eaten to fuel a necromantic ritual Hazel gained superhuman strength. He escaped, joined Rajit\u2019s cult in the North Cemetery, mastered weekly rituals, and became the cemetery\u2019s gravedigger. His continued cannibalism cemented his power but cursed him with an insatiable appetite. A failed summoning in desperation drew the Mists and trapped him in Ravenloft.",
