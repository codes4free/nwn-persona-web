## How It Works

Our Platform connects directly to your game's chat systems, processing logs to detect active characters and generate in-character AI responses. The easy-to-use web dashboard allows administrators to manage character profiles, view chat history, and adjust AI behavior without ever touching server configurations.

The service comes with a dedicated NWNLogClient application (downloadable as NWNLogClient_Setup.exe) that streams game logs to our secure cloud servers, ensuring a seamless and integrated gaming experience.

### Conversation Context Window

The Conversation Context Window feature enhances AI-generated responses by providing relevant conversation history to the AI model:

1. When selecting a message to respond to, the system collects recent conversation context
2. This includes both character-specific messages and the recent overall conversation
3. The AI uses this context to generate more coherent and contextually appropriate responses
4. No configuration required - it works automatically and is indicated by a context badge

For more information about this feature, see the [Context Window Documentation](docs/CONTEXT_WINDOW.md).
